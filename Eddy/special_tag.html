            <h1>Special tags that need "more"</h1>
            <h2>button</h2>
            <p>Here is an example of the button tag. It is a little bit misleading since it is a button that doesn't do anything. You would want to add some interactivity, perhaps with JavaScript. </p>
            <button>Open</button><br>
            <button>Close</button><hr>
            <h2>meter</h2>
            <p>The meter tag is cool and can take a lot of attributes. But again it is better if you have some code that can make the attribute values dynamic instead of "hardcoding" them. When you think meter, think of a fianl sroce for a test. </p>
            <meter min="0" max="100" value="50">50%</meter><br>
            <meter id="b" value=".25">25%</meter><br>
            <meter min="5" max="10" value="8">60%</meter>
            <hr>
            <h2>progress</h2>
            <p>The progress tag has a very similar layout to the meter tag. The difference is that there is an assumption that there will be a progression to where the value will equal 100. This tag is often used when filling out a form that has many pages of question. </p>
            <progress id="work" value="75" max="100">75%</progress>
            <hr>
            <h2>iframe</h2>
            <p>The iframe is used to nest content. It is not supported equally by all browsers. You will want to explore setting amny of the different options such as height and width. </p>
            <iframe src="https://www.checkifdown.com/"></iframe><br />

            <p>You can set the width to something greater</p>
            <iframe src="https://www.checkifdown.com/" width="1200px" height="400px"></iframe><br />
            <hr>
            <h2>bdo</h2>
            <p>bdo stands for bidirectional override. This tag can be used to change the direction of the text. </p>
            <p>This text will go left to right.</p>
            <p><bdo dir="rtl">This text will go right to left.</bdo></p>
        </div>
