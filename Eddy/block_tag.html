            <h1 style="font-size: 200%;">hr</h1>
            <p>The < hr> element used to stand for "horizontal line" and that is still how it is typically displayed by browsers. However, in HTML5 the tag took on a semantic meaning, "semantic break". I will be using it often to break up example files when I want to display multiple tags in one file.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 200%;">address</h1>
            <p>The < address> element indicates that the text is an address specific to the page, perhaps contact information for the author.</p>
            <br>
            <address>1715 Walnut Blvd<br>Ashtabula OH 44004</address>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 200%;">blockquote</h1>
            <p>The < blockquote> element is used for extend quotations. It should include the cite attribute in order to show or link to the source of the quote.</p>
            <blockquote>"If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way." Napolean Hill</blockquote>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="font-size: 200%;">details</h1>
            <p>The < details> element is used in conjunction with the < summary> tag. It is one of the tags that was created in response to the repeated use of scripting to open and close content. It is not supported by all of the browesers yet though.</p>
            <details><summary>The summary</summary></details>
            <hr>
